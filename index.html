            <img src="./assets/raze-valorant.webp" alt="Raze Valorant">
            <p>Prepare to bring the boom with the Valorant Raze guide filled with the best tips and tricks. Let’s dive
                into the explosive world of Raze and find out all about the fiery duelist.

            </p>
            <p>Raze is all about creating chaos and leaving a trail of annihilation in her wake. She is also one of the
                most popular agents in the game. Considered the most OP character in Valorant, most players are curious
                about the best map to play as Raze alongside her strong and weak aspects.</p>
            <h3>Valorant Raze Guide</h3>
            <p>
                Raze boasts a solid arsenal of explosives and high-octane abilities. Thanks to the massive amount of
                damage she can deal, she is the first choice of thousands in Valorant. Let’s break down her abilities to
                see what the master of explosives is all about.
            </p>
            <h3>Raze Abilities</h3>
            <p>
                Blast Pack: Blast Pack is Raze’s bread-and-butter ability. It is simply an explosive that can be
                detonated remotely. It is highly effective in both dealing damage to enemies and giving Raze a broader
                vision of the battlefield. That’s because the Blast Pack allows Raze to propel herself into the air.
            </p>

            <p>The Valorant community calls it air strafing. Thanks to the Blast Pack it is possible to increase your
                movement speed as well. Mastering this ability is key to maximizing Raze’s potential in Valorant.</p>
            <h3>Raze Abilities</h3>

            <p>Paint Shells: Paint Shells is the agent’s signature ability. And it launches a cluster
                grenade that explodes into smaller ones upon touching the ground. Similar to Boom Bot, it is perfect to
                flush enemies out of covers and tight spots. As it can deal area-of-effect damage, Paint Shells is a
                critical ability that you need to master.</p>

            <p>Boom Bot: Raze deploys a mini robot that constantly scans for enemies. Upon detecting a
                foe in its line of sight, the Boom Bot starts following the enemy until it explodes.</p>

            <p>The Boom Bot does not only allow Raze to scout ahead but also reveals the enemy’s location. Boom Bot is a
                great ability that can also force enemies to change their cover, rendering them vulnerable.</p>

            <p>Showstopper: You should brace yourself for the big guns as Raze’s ultimate ability
                allows her to equip a massive rocket launcher.</p>

            <p>The highly aggressive agent’s rocket launcher obliterates anything in its path. It also deals near-lethal
                damage and boasts a wide blast radius. The best tip for Raze’s ultimate ability would be to use it in
                team fights.</p>

            <p>It is also extremely useful to break through entrenched defenses or eliminate grouped-up enemies.</p>
